I'll scan the key files related to keybindings, the command palette, and MCP services to pinpoint tight coupling and propose concrete refactors. Pulling them up now.

I reviewed the command palette, keybindings, and MCP pieces. The main tight couplings are:
- UI components directly mutate global atoms (via `getDefaultStore()`) and reach into other services (`gitChat`, MCP client) instead of using a clear boundary.
- Command palette mixes view concerns with command registry/state, and encodes hierarchy in label strings.
- MCP client both orchestrates connections and owns global state updates; server route also reaches directly into the same connection singleton.
- Types and utilities (e.g., `McpUrl`) are duplicated; URL/name derivation lives in the component.

Here are targeted refactors to make it more loosely coupled and testable.

### decouple state management from services
- Move Jotai writes out of service classes. Make services pure and event-driven.
  - Define a minimal domain interface and event bus:
```ts
// services/mcp/ports.ts
export type McpConnectionEvent =
  | { type: "connecting"; server: string }
  | { type: "connected"; server: string; tools: Record<string, Tool> }
  | { type: "failed"; server: string; error: string }
  | { type: "disconnected"; server: string };

export interface McpConnections {
  updateConnections(urls: McpUrl[]): Promise<void>;
  reconnect(server: string): Promise<void>;
  on(listener: (e: McpConnectionEvent) => void): () => void; // unsubscribe
}
```
- Implement the interface in `lib/mcp-connection-manager.ts` and emit events; remove any atom knowledge from `services/mcp/client.ts`.
- Add an adapter in `services/mcp/state-adapter.ts` that subscribes to events and updates `toolsAtom`, `breakdownAtom`, `connectionStatusAtom`, etc. UI then depends only on atoms, not on the service implementation.

### introduce a command registry (DI) instead of hardcoding in `cmdk.tsx`
- Split a registry from the view:
  - `services/commands/registry.ts` exposes `registerCommandSource(source)` and `useCommands()` that aggregates.
  - A `CommandSource` provides an id, optional parent id, label, and an `execute()` or `children()` function. No hierarchy in label strings.
```ts
// services/commands/types.ts
export type Command = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  parentId?: string;
  run?: () => void | Promise<void>;
};
export interface CommandSource {
  id: string;
  list(): Command[]; // pure, derived from its own store(s)
}
```
- `components/cmdk.tsx` reads a derived atom `allCommandsAtom` that flattens across registered sources and renders a proper tree. Remove `HIERARCHY_SEPARATOR` and the `atomWithStorage` initialization that mixes static and dynamic content. Only persist user-defined custom commands separately if needed.
- Feature modules register themselves:
  - MCP: provides “MCP Servers & Tools”
  - Models: provides “Set Model” and children for each model
  - Chat: provides “New Thread”, “Export Chat”, “Search Messages” populated from a chat store selector instead of capturing `gitChat` directly.

### centralize keybinding suspension
- Replace repeated effects toggling `keybindingsActiveAtom` in dialogs/overlays with a hook:
```ts
// hooks/useSuspendKeybindings.ts
export function useSuspendKeybindings(suspend: boolean) {
  const set = useSetAtom(keybindingsActiveAtom);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (suspend) set(false);
    return () => set(true);
  }, [suspend, set]);
}
```
- Use in `CmdK` and `McpUrlManager` to avoid direct atom writes scattered across the codebase. Keep `components/keybinding.tsx` purely presentational and pass an explicit `isActive` if you want to remove the global entirely.

### clarify MCP layering and remove duplication
- Single source of truth for `McpUrl` in `types/mcp.ts`. Import everywhere; remove duplicated interface declarations.
- Keep one connection manager singleton per runtime boundary:
  - In the browser: `lib/mcp-connection-manager.ts` implements `McpConnections`.
  - On the server route: either reuse the same interface with a separate instance scoped to the request/session, or accept tools from the client rather than reconnecting again in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. Right now the route re-calls `updateConnections`, which duplicates work and couples server to the same global manager. Pick one:
    - Option A (client-sourced): Client passes `breakdown` and `tools` snapshot with the request; server uses it directly for `streamText`.
    - Option B (server-owned): Server maintains its own manager instance keyed by user/session; client only sends URLs. Keep the browser manager independent and don’t import it server-side.
- Collapse `services/mcp/tools-service.ts` into a thin transformation layer:
  - It should only convert manager output to UI format (serialization, failed-entry labeling), not call atoms.
  - `services/mcp/client.ts` becomes an orchestrator that calls the manager and then emits domain events; the state adapter updates atoms.

### remove label-encoded structure and side effects
- Stop deriving hierarchy from `command.name.split(HIERARCHY_SEPARATOR)`. Keep structure in data (`parentId` or explicit children) and render breadcrumbs from the tree.
- Eliminate `getDefaultStore()` mutations from outside React flows:
  - For actions like “set model”, “open dialog”, expose explicit action functions in their own modules that update their stores. `cmdk` should invoke those actions, not poke atoms directly.

### extract pure utilities and cover with tests
- From `components/mcp-url-manager.tsx`, move:
  - `validateUrl` and `generateServerName` into `utils/mcp.ts`.
  - `getCleanUrlForDisplay` into the same utils.
- Add simple unit tests for these to prevent regressions and to make the component only orchestrate UI.

### improve loading/connection status modeling
- Replace the “connecting servers” Set plus a map in atoms with either:
  - An `atomFamily<string, "idle" | "connecting" | "connected" | "failed">` per server, or
  - A single `Record<string, { status: ..., error?: string }>` derived from the event stream.
- The manager should emit fine-grained per-server events; UI derives global summaries, avoiding ad-hoc state updates sprinkled across the client.

### tighten server API boundary
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` should not be aware of connection lifecycle if the client already manages it. Either:
  - Accept a `tools` payload from the client and pass it to `streamText`, or
  - Own connections server-side and not import the browser singleton. Right now the import couples environments and can surprise in SSR.

### small cleanups
- Co-locate atoms with their domain (commands/MCP/chat), but expose selectors instead of raw atoms to the UI where possible.
- Unify `Tool` serialization shape under `utils/tool-serialization.ts` and only serialize in UI adapters; keep core services dealing with raw `Tool`.

Status update:
- I reviewed `components/keybinding.tsx`, `components/cmdk.tsx`, `components/mcp-url-manager.tsx`, `services/mcp/{client.ts,tools-service.ts}`, `lib/mcp-connection-manager.ts`, `utils/tool-serialization.ts`, and `app/api/chat/route.ts`. The proposals above target the specific coupling points I found. If you’d like, I can implement the minimal skeletons (ports, registry, keybinding hook) to make subsequent changes incremental.

- Key changes to pursue:
  - Define `McpConnections` interface and move Jotai writes to a state adapter.
  - Add a command registry and remove label-encoded hierarchy from `cmdk`.
  - Add `useSuspendKeybindings` and use it in dialogs.
  - Deduplicate `McpUrl` type and move MCP utilities to `utils/mcp.ts`.
  - Decide on server vs client ownership of MCP connections and adjust `app/api/chat/route.ts` accordingly.
